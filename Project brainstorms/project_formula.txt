Formula for text-as-data research 


What question do you want to answer? This should be something you *actually* want to know, and it should end in a question mark.
Has Trump's rhetoric surrounding "fake news" increased distrust of media on Twitter?

What source of text data will you use?
All of Trump's transcribed speeches as president and twitter data

What are two possible answers to the question?
Yes he has increased media distrst, no he has not affected media distrust

How will the results of the quantitative text analysis demonstrate which of those answers is correct?
If tweets involving distrust of media increase as Trump's frequency of using the phrase "fake news" increases, it will provide some evidence that he has increased media distrust.
